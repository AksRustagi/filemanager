## Overview

In general, the Dropbox API uses HTTP POST requests with JSON
arguments and JSON responses. Request authentication is via OAuth 2.0
using the Authorization request header or authorization URL parameter.

Uses RPC approach.

An API is built by defining public methods; then, the methods are
called with arguments. RPC is just a bunch of functions, but in the
context of an HTTP API, that entails putting the method in the URL and
the arguments in the query string or body.
